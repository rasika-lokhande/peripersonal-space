From bottom of my heart, I offer gratitude to the following people, who have been instrumental in bringing this work into existence.

To Prof. Devpriya Kumar, my supervisor, for the unwavering patience in guidance and answering every little question of mine, teaching me everything I know today about research, and cracking cringe-worthy jokes that have mostly succeeded in keeping my spirits up!

To Saee and Roshan, for the memes and laughter, for the long hours of conversations and hang-outs, and for the unparalleled emotional support!

To my colleagues in the lab and the department- Aditi, Rujuta, Arjun, Revati, Ishan, Hariharan, Shivani, Anjali, and others- for  being present to listen to my thoughts, ideas, and questions, and always ending the conversation with a variant of "Ho Jaayega"! 

To Mummy and Pappa, for making sure that I'm eating properly, even from a thousand kilometers away!

And lastly, to Butterscotch, Brownie, and Caramel, for joining me for chai and biscuits for many of my evenings, never hesitating to show affection through jumps, barks, and a lot of dog-hair left on my clothes.
